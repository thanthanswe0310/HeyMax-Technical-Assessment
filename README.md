# HeyMax Technical Assessment Submission

## 1. Installation of Required Packages
   Installed the following packages in VSCode:
    pip                 25.0.1  
    pandas              2.0.3  
    psycopg2-binary     2.9.9

## 2. PostgreSQL Setup for Data Warehouse
    To build the data warehouse and load analytics into the dashboard, I used the PostgreSQL database.
    I downloaded and installed the following version:
    
    postgresql-17.5-1-windows-x64

## 3. Database Table Creation
  After installing PostgreSQL, I created two tables: a fact table and a dimension table before inserting data from the provided dataset (event_stream.csv).

## 4. ETL Pipeline Development
   I developed an ETL pipeline using Python to insert data into the appropriate tables. The script was written and executed in VSCode.

## 5. Dashboard Integration
   I connected PostgreSQL to Power BI Desktop to create the HeyMax Technical Assessment Dashboard, which visualizes growth accounting metrics based on the required queries.

## 6. Batch Processing
   This pipeline is designed to run as a daily batch process.


# Thank You!!!!
